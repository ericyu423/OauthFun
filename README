Notes:
Auth workflow
1. register App with an redirect_url, get public key and Client ID
2. Use key and ID to get token to access API, token will be added behind the redirect_url

- redirect_url

* if it can be registered in format scheme://, scheme can be added in plist to redirect back to the App NXOAuth2Client library can be used.

* stackapp does not take redirect_url in the above format of WKWebview will be used and use it's delegate to intercept token.
