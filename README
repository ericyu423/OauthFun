Incomplete:
CoreData model setup but no logic to write/fetch user data offline





Possible Bug when Cloning project:

clang:error no such file or directory:

Model:
StockUser+coreDataClass.h
StockUser+CoreDataClass.m
StockUser+CoreDataProperties.h
StockUser+CoreDataProperties.m

Xcode showing file missing

To Fix go to folder
OathFun(project name) -> OathFun -> Model
drag out all missing files back to xcode
